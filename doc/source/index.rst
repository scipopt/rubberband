Welcome to Rubberband's documentation!
======================================

Rubberband is a flexible archiving and analysis tool written in python for optimization benchmarks.
Its main purpose is the organization and evaluation of logfiles of Solvers during development.
Rubberband consists of a python `tornado <http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/>`_ application running on a webserver (like nginx or apache) and can authenticate users via `oauth2_proxy <http://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy>`_.
There is an optional `gitlab <http://gitlab.com/>`_ connection for linkage of users and commits.
All of the data is stored in an `elasticsearch <http://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_ database, including the logfiles themselves.
As a tool for parsing the logfiles, rubberband utilizes `IPET <http://github.com/GregorCH/ipet>`_.
